Scaling Up (vertical scaling) :– increasing the number CPUs or adding faster CPUs on a single box.
Scaling Out (horizontal scaling) :– increasing the number of boxes.	 

Database can be split vertically (Partitioning) or horizontally (Sharding).

Vertically splitting (Partitioning) :– Database can be split into multiple loosely coupled sub-databases based of domain concepts. Eg:– Customer database, Product Database etc. Another way to split database is by moving few columns of an entity to one database and few other columns to another database. Eg:– Customer database , Customer contact Info database, Customer Orders database etc.

Horizontally splitting (Sharding) :– Database can be horizontally split into multiple database based on some discrete attribute. Eg:– American Customers database, European Customers database.
